Tip: Use a **password manager** and **passkeys** wherever possible. Less friction, more security, and if you're like me, you're going to forget your new passwords anyways and have to reset it every time you try to login because you can't reuse previous passwords. I've reset my Amazon password about 30 times, I swear to god.
