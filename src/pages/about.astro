    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm Travis (Nova). I break, build, and secure things — and sometimes write about it. Interests: AI, cybersecurity, DIY, philosophy, anime, and building playful web stuff.</p>
    <p>Based in Florida. I post bite‑sized notes in the blog and share experiments in the Fun Zone.</p>
